## The use cases for storage proofs

Since storage proofs allow us to efficiently “compress” a blockchain and transmit the data elsewhere, they have quite a few applications. The affordable verification cost, an integral property of storage proofs, allows the proof to be validated on the destination chain, minimizing the need to develop cross-chain messaging systems.

Potential use cases include:

- **General information access** of one chain from another about state and transactions on the blockchain.

- **Simplified cross-chain voting systems.** Frequently users hold their assets on a slow but more secure chain A, but some token-based voting occurs on a chain B with cheaper transactions. This forces the user to either skip their vote or pay huge transaction fees to bridge their assets from A to B, cast their vote, then bridge them back to A. In such cases, storage proofs enable users to prove their token balance on chain A at a given block and seamlessly cast their vote on chain B.

- **Alternative to cross-chain bridges.** Currently, cross-chain bridges assume a level of trust in a third party because they typically involve an intermediary, such as a custodian or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This intermediary is responsible for ensuring that a certain amount of tokens are received on the source chain by the intermediary and for holding the assets on the source chain. Afterward, the corresponding tokens are minted on the destination chain. Storage proofs can enable trustless cross-chain bridges since a smart contract application on the destination chain could validate a transaction where assets were transferred to the bridge smart contract on the source chain and mint the bridged assets. However, in many cases the need of transferring assets between chains may be eliminated since ownership of assets on another chain could be simply proven with storage proofs.

- **Enhanced UX for Account Abstraction (AA) use cases.** AA has been implemented in different chains and is considered a crucial innovation in onboarding the first billion users to the blockchain space. With storage proofs, wallets could include the additional functionality of restoring access only if the wallet did not send any transactions over a long duration. Additional checks that require some data to be used from other chains could also be enforced.


## An example of a storage proof

Generating storage proofs on EVM-compatible chains is straightforward. For example, Web3.js library has the `getProof` function that can generate proof of a contract’s state on Ethereum (and other EVM-compatible chains such as Polygon or BSC). A contract address and the storage slot for the contract must be passed to the function.

In Ethereum, smart contracts use a key-value store to store data in their storage. Each piece of data is stored in a specific location known as a “storage slot.” Storage slots are memory locations within the contract’s storage and are identified by a unique index. Let’s look at a sample smart contract with the following code deployed on Ethereum mainnet at [0xcc…da8b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcca577ee56d30a444c73f8fc8d5ce34ed1c7da8b#code).
